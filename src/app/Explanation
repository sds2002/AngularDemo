How It Works

CarService holds cars in a BehaviorSubject.

Components subscribe to cars$.

Whenever a car is added/updated, carsSubject.next() pushes the latest array to all subscribers.

Both Dashboard and Garage stay in sync automatically.

âœ… Now you have reactive runtime polymorphism in Angular:

Shared state via service

Reactive updates with RxJS

Multiple components see changes instantly
