What Happens?

If you click Test Drive on Toyota Corolla â†’
â†’ calls Car.drive() â†’
â†’ "Toyota Corolla is driving normally ðŸš—"

If you click Test Drive on Tesla Model 3 â†’
â†’ calls overridden method ElectricCar.drive() â†’
â†’ "Tesla Model 3 is driving silently âš¡"

âœ… This is runtime polymorphism in action:
Even though the array is typed as Car[], at runtime Angular/TypeScript dispatches the actual method depending on the objectâ€™s type (Car vs. ElectricCar).
