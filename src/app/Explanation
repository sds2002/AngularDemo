What is a Class in TypeScript?

A class is a blueprint for creating objects.
It defines data (properties/fields) and logic (methods) that belong to the object.

Explanation

Data (Properties / Fields)

brand, model, year → public (can be accessed outside).

speed → private (hidden, accessible only inside the class).

Constructor

Runs automatically when new Car(...) is called.

Initializes properties.

Methods (Logic)

drive() → increases speed.

brake() → decreases speed safely (never negative).

getSpeed() → exposes speed in a controlled way.

displayInfo() → prints details.

Encapsulation

We used private for speed so outside code cannot directly modify it → protects logic.
