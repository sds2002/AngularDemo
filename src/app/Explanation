How It Works

CarService stores the cars array.

Both DashboardComponent and GarageComponent inject the same CarService (singleton by default).

If you accelerate/charge a car in Dashboard, the updated state is reflected in Garage too (shared instance).

This is Angular’s dependency injection + service pattern at work.

✅ Now you have a real Angular setup:

Models → Car, ElectricCar

Service → CarService (manages shared data)

Components → Dashboard (interacts with cars), Garage (shows stored cars)
