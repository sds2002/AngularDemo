Explanation

ElectricCar extends Car → inherits all Car properties/methods.

super(...) → calls parent constructor.

Method overriding → displayInfo() was redefined to show battery info.

New methods → chargeBattery() and useBattery() only exist in ElectricCar.

✅ Now you have inheritance in Angular with TypeScript classes:

Base Car → normal cars.

Derived ElectricCar → EV-specific logic.
