Key Points

Type safety: User ensures the data structure is consistent.

Services & Interfaces: Using interfaces in services ensures components get expected data.

IDE benefits: Auto-completion for user.name, user.email, etc.

Scalable: If the API changes, updating the interface updates types across the app.

This setup is fully functional. When you run ng serve, you'll see a list of users with active/inactive status styled.
