Angular CLI Overview
----------------------
Angular CLI is a command-line tool to create, manage, and build Angular applications efficiently. It automates many tasks, like generating components, services, modules, and building the app for deployment.

npm install -g @angular/cli
ng version
ng new my-app
ng serve

2. Modules
-----------
Modules group related code together. Every Angular app has at least one module: AppModule.
ng generate module user / ng g m user
ng generate component header / ng g c header
ng g c footer --inline-template --inline-style

4. Services
-----------
Services hold business logic or shared data.

ng generate service data / ng g s data

5. Routing
-----------
Routing allows navigation between different components.

CLI Example to generate a module with routing:
ng g m dashboard --routing

6. Directives
-------------
Directives are instructions to manipulate the DOM.

Structural directives: *ngIf, *ngFor

Attribute directives: [ngStyle], [ngClass]

7. Pipes
-----------
Pipes transform data in templates.

8. Data Binding
----------------
Angular supports several types:

Interpolation: {{ title }}

Property binding: [disabled]="isDisabled"

Event binding: (click)="onClick()"

Two-way binding: [(ngModel)]="name" (needs FormsModule)

9. Dependency Injection
--------------------------
Angular uses DI to provide services to components.

constructor(private dataService: DataService) { }

10. Build & Deployment
----------------------
Build the project for production:

ng build --prod


Output in dist/my-app

Ready to deploy on servers.
