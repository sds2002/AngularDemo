Explanation

Built-in Pipes are pure functions that transform data.

uppercase → converts string to uppercase

date → formats a Date object

currency → formats number as currency

percent → converts number to percentage

slice → slices array/string

json → pretty-prints object

Async Pipe

Handles Observable and Promise automatically.

Subscribes/unsubscribes automatically → no memory leaks.

Useful for data coming from APIs (HttpClient).

✅ With this, you now understand Built-in Pipes + Async Pipe in Angular with full code and output.
