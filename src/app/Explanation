What is a Custom Pipe?

A custom pipe lets you create your own transformation logic.

Example: reversing a string, filtering an array, formatting text, etc.

Pipe → Decorator that marks this class as a pipe.

PipeTransform → Interface that requires transform() method.

transform(value: any, ...args: any[]): any → where we write the logic.

In this case:

If no value → return empty string.

Otherwise → split string into chars → reverse → join again.
