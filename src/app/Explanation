Explanation

items: array we want to filter.

searchText: the text user types.

field: the object property to filter on (e.g., name).

pure: false: tells Angular to re-run the pipe when input changes (important for filtering).

Key Takeaways

Custom filter pipes are powerful for quick search functionality.

pure: false ensures the pipe runs on every keystroke.

Always pass the field (like 'name') so pipe is reusable for multiple properties.
