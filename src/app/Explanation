Explanation

cars: Car[] → can hold both Car and ElectricCar objects (polymorphism).

Angular template calls car.displayInfo() →

For Car, it shows normal info.

For ElectricCar, the overridden method runs, showing battery info. ✅

chargeIfEV() uses instanceof to check if the object is ElectricCar before charging.

✅ Now, your dashboard will:

List all cars dynamically.

Show correct info depending on whether it’s a Car or ElectricCar.

Use the same array & template thanks to polymorphism.
